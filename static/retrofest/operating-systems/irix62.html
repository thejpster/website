</ul>
<h3><a name="HDR0">1.1 Standards</a></h3>
<p>IRIX 6.2 conforms to the following industry standards:</p>
<h4><a name="HDR1">1.1.1 X/Open</a></h4>
<p>IRIX 6.2 is among the first operating systems from a major systems vendor
to receive the X/Open Base 95 Profile branding from the X/Open Company Ltd.
All vendors who claim to support the evolution of UNIX to a single, common
specification must achieve this milestone. </p>
<h4><a name="HDR2">1.1.2 SVID</a></h4>
<p>IRIX 6.2 provides a substantial subset of the API described in the System
V Interface Definition, Issue 3 (SVID3), the defining document for System
V Release 4 (SVR4). Compliance with the SVR4 API is tested using a variety
of commercial and public domain test packages. One of the most comprehensive
of these is the Generic ABI Test Suite (gABI) developed by UNISOFT. The
gABI is a comprehensive test of the compliance of the system consisting
of more than 7,800 tests.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR3">1.1.3 MIPS ABI</a></h4>
<p>IRIX 6.2 will be the reference platform for the MIPS ABI 1.2.1 and compliant
with the MIPS ABI 1.1. IRIX 5.3 remains the reference platform for the MIPS
ABI 1.1. The MIPS ABI is defined in the Black Book (MIPS ABI Conformance
Guide), and is determined by the member companies.</p>
<p>Previous releases of IRIX have been selected as the reference platform by
the MIPS ABI group. The member companies---all the vendors that offer SVR4
on MIPS processors---agreed that a suitably compiled binary from IRIX would
operate correctly on their platforms.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR4">1.1.4 POSIX</a></h4>
<p>IRIX 6.2 meets the standards established by the POSIX 1003.1 Specification.
IRIX has been certified as complying with the FIPS 151-1 interpretation
of P1003.1 since IRIX 4.0.5, and as complying with the 1990 version, corresponding
to FIPS 151-2, since IRIX 5.2.</p>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 incorporates SVR4 commands and utilities that are fully compliant
with the POSIX 1003.2 Specifications. Compliance was certified by the X/Open
Base 95 Profile branding.</p>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 provides many of the interfaces specified by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1b-1993
(formerly 1003.4 Draft 14) standard for real time.</p>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 contains kernel enhancements for the support of real-time programming
and guaranteed interrupt latencies. POSIX 1003.1c threads (pthreads) the
industry standard for multithreaded programming, are supported as part of
the REACT/pro<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> product for IRIX 6.2. 

<h4><a name="HDR5">1.1.5 Single UNIX&#174; Specification (SPEC 1170)</a></h4>
<p>
Silicon Graphics provides most of the Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) defined in the X/Open &quot;Single UNIX Specification&quot; UNIX 95 (formerly
SPEC 1170). Silicon Graphics is committed to complying fully with this X/Open
standard, which will enable software developers to produce products portable
to any version of the UNIX operating system that supports the specification.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR6">1.2 User Interface and Graphics </a></h3>
<p>
Silicon Graphics provides a single, advanced user interface across its product
line, plus a broad range of standard and optional graphics and visualization
development tools.</p>

<p>
Leading-edge technology continues to be the focus for the developer user
interface libraries for IRIX 6.2. IRIX 6.2 supports Release 6 of the X11
Window System for both client and server and IRIX IM, Silicon Graphics'
enhanced version of OSF Motif 1.2.4. The X11R6 libraries and IRIX IM libraries
have been updated to support 32-bit and 64-bit addressing. In addition,
there is support for CID keyed fonts and the X double buffering extension,
and features for font installation and management have been added.</p>

<li>Korn Shell (ksh: /bin/ksh /usr/bin/ksh /sbin/ksh)<br>
 
</ul>
<p>All shells are programmable and allow for a tailorable-character user environment.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR14">1.3 Filesystems</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 provides an advanced filesystem with leading-edge features. It
also supports a range of alternate filesystems for distributed and standards-based
data access.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR15">1.3.1 File Services</a></h4>
<p>
The IRIX file subsystem supports multiple physical disks and gives them
the appearance of a single, logical filesystem with a hierarchical arrangement.
Additionally, XFS filesystems may include plexed and non-plexed components.</p>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 uses the Virtual Filesystem interface facilitates the inclusion
of several filesystem types into IRIX 6.2, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>EFS<br>
 
<li>XFS<br>
 
<li>Network Filesystem (NFS)<br>
 
<li>ISO 9660 (CDFS)<br>
 
<li>DOS (floppy only)<br>
 
<li>swap<br>
 
<li>/proc Filesystem<br>
 
</ul>
<h4><a name="HDR16">1.3.2 EFS</a></h4>
<p>
Ten years ago, SGI replaced the standard UNIX filesystem with EFS, a higher-performance
and higher-capacity filesystem needed by SGI's most demanding customers.
EFS increases throughput by supporting 64 KB extents instead of the 8KB
or smaller blocks in some UNIX implementations. EFS also implements 8 GB
filesystems in 2GB filesystems found on traditional UNIX systems. </p>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 still supports EFS for compatibility, but SGI recommends rapid
conversion to XFS, one of the most advanced filesystems available from any
vendor, and now a standard part of IRIX.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR17">1.3.3 XFS<tt><font size="3"></a>TM</font></tt><a name="HDR17"> </a></h4>
<p>
Designed from the ground up, XFS is an advanced 64-bit journaled filesystem
with integrated volume management and guaranteed rate I/O. XFS supports
files as large as 9 million TB (2<em>63-1</em>). With systems that have a 32-bit address space, the filesystem limit is
one TB on files and filesystems. Filesystems can grow to 18 TB or one TB
with a 32-bit kernel, and individual directories have successfully held
67 million files in internal testing. Aggregate read/write performance exceeds
500 MB per second; single-descriptor performance is over 400 MB per second. </p>
<p>
The XFS filesystem has a full range of graphical system administration tools
to create, delete, mount, export, and modify filesystems.</p>
<p>
XFS uses database journaling technology to provide very fast recovery. No
filesystem checking utility is needed---the system quickly references a
small log of recently updated filesystem transactions after a system crash.
Logging filesystems scale as disks and CPUs are added; traditional UNIX
filesystem checking utilities do not.</p>
<p>
The XFS filesystem supports logical block sizes ranging from 512 bytes to
1 GB. Filesystem extents, which provide contiguous data within a file, are
configurable at file creation time and are multiples of the filesystem block
size. The contiguous data control features of XFS greatly increase I/O throughput
because there is no delay due to disk seeks or rotational latency in accessing
data stored on disk. </p>
<p>
Guaranteed rate I/O makes XFS the only filesystem available that allows
applications to reserve specific bandwidth to or from the filesystem.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR18">1.3.4 NFS<tt><font size="3"></a>TM</font></tt><a name="HDR18"> </a></h4>
<p>Distributed filesystems simplify the way data is accessed by making remote
files appear local. NFS, with an installed base of more than 3 million seats,
is the de facto UNIX standard for distributed filesystems. </p>
<p>
Until recently, virtually all NFS implementations used the NFS Version 2
protocol (NFSv2). NFSv2 was not designed with today's high-performance networks
or large file sizes in mind. </p>
<p>
Silicon Graphics implemented NFS Version 3 (NFSv3) for the first time in
IRIX 5.3. The Version 3 protocol also allows 64-bit file addressing, which
makes it possible to use NFS to transfer files larger than 2 GB over the
network for the first time. Since V2 compatibility is preserved in ONC+
(in a more efficient implementation) customers get the best of both worlds:
the performance of NFSv3 with the backward-compatibility of NFSv2.</p>
<p>
To enhance file sharing performance and reduce network load, NFS clients
can use the Cache Filesystem (CFS) function, retaining a copy of frequently
accessed remote files locally and updating the cached copy only when the
original has been changed. </p>
<p>
The Network Information System (NIS) is provided for centralized filesystem
management. The automounter service automatically mounts and unmounts NFS
filesystems. The NFS locking service, lockd, allows locks to be used with
remotely mounted files. </p>
<h4><a name="HDR19">1.3.5 ISO 9660</a></h4>
<p>
ISO 9660 is a filesystem type used to mount CD-ROM discs in the High Sierra
or ISO 9660 formats (with or without the Rock Ridge extensions) formats. </p>
<h4><a name="HDR20">1.3.6 DOS and Macintosh Floppies</a></h4>
<p>
The DOS filesystem driver supports 5.25-inch floppy drives in three standard
formats when used with the freestanding SCSI floppy drive. The standard
single- and double-density, dual-sided 3.5-inch drive and the 3.5-inch 20.1MB
floptical drive are also supported, as are HFS/MAC formats.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR21">1.3.7 swap</a></h4>
<p>
swap allows either a file or block device to be used as a swap resource.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR22">1.3.8 /proc</a></h4>
<p>
The /proc filesystem allows running processes to be accessed and manipulated
as files by ordinary system calls, such as open, close, read, write, seek,
and ioctl.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR23">1.4 Volume Management</a></h3>
<p>
The XFS volume manager xlv is a superset of the lv volume manager. It supports
striping, concatenation, and, optionally, disk mirroring. The system administrator
can make online dynamic changes to volumes, including extending the size
of a mounted filesystem, with a full set of graphical system administration
tools.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR24">1.5 Networking Standards</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 implements the following Internet RFC (Request for Comment) and
non-RFC standards, among others: </p>

<h3><a name="HDR25">1.6 Memory Management</a></h3>
<p>
The IRIX virtual memory subsystem is based on SVR4 and supports mmap() and
mprotect(). The region structure has its roots in SVR3 with major modifications
to support MP cache flushing and TLB management. Virtual memory is managed
with a classic demand-paged model. </p>
<p>
IRIX supports low-cost forks, also known as Copy On Write (COW) or lazy
replication. Unique pages are created only when the child process writes
to a particular page. </p>
<p>
The size of swap partitions can be reduced or augmented on a running system.
Applications can swap to NFS partitions, to mirrored partitions, and to
regular files. Memory management policies and performance can be tuned using
variables documented on the systune man page.</p>
<p>
On IRIX 6.2 physical memory can be up to 16 GB, allowing more tasks and/or
larger tasks to be in memory simultaneously. A 64-bit user process can grow
to a virtual address space of 2<em>40</em> bytes (1 TB) if the physical system has sufficient memory and swap space.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR26">1.7 Scheduling</a></h3>
<p>
An IRIX process is a collection of resources and a thread of execution within
an SGI computer system. The virtual address space of a process, the contents
of its user structure and proc table entry, and the values contained in
machine registers when the process is running constitute the context of
the process.</p>
<p>
To support multiple processes, IRIX implements a process-scheduling algorithm
that assures a fairly equitable division of processor time among all processes.
This algorithm is non-preemptive, that is, the running process cannot be
preempted by another process (but can be preempted by the kernel).</p>
<p>
The running process can yield to another process &quot;voluntarily,&quot; by making
a system call (such as an I/O request) that causes it to sleep, in which
case another process is selected to run. The running process can also be
preempted by the kernel to handle an exception, in which case the process
is rescheduled to resume immediately after the exception handler is finished.</p>
<p>
The kernel also enforces limits on the amount of time a process can monopolize
the processor (time slicing).</p>
<p>
While the process management model discussed represents an apparently equitable
resource sharing model, multiple CPUs make the task more challenging. Further
complexities are added when the scheduler must handle batch and real-time
queues in addition to timesharing users.</p>
<p>
The scheduler in IRIX 6.2 is designed to handle all these difficult hardware
and application environments individually and in combination (recognizing
that the goals of timesharing, batch, and real-time are often contradictory).</p>
<p>
There are four major classes of priorities in IRIX 6.2. Two of these priority
types have multiple subclasses:</p>
<pre>
Table 1-3 Scheduling Priorities       
--------------------------------------
<b>Class</b>                <b>Subclasses</b>       
--------------------------------------
Kernel                                
User-mode Real-time  Frame Scheduler  
Timesharing          Gang, General    
Background           Gang, General    
                                      
--------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Kernel tasks have the highest priority, background processes the lowest.
Subclasses within a type can have any priority within the range assigned
to that type.</p>
<p>Scheduling options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gang Scheduling<br>
 
<li>Deadline Scheduling<br>
 
<li>Processor Sets<br>
 
<li>Processor Cache Affinity<br>
 
</ul>
<h4><a name="HDR27">1.7.1 Gang Scheduling</a></h4>
<p>
The user can schedule related processes or threads to run as a group. Threads
that communicate with each other using locks or semaphores will be assured
of running in parallel, avoiding waiting while the receiving or sending
process is swapped in and then associated performance penalty. </p>
<h4><a name="HDR28">1.7.2 Deadline Scheduling</a></h4>
<p>
The system administrator can specify that a particular process will receive
a specified allocation of CPU time in any recurring period. The primary
beneficiaries are applications where constant delivery of a video or audio
stream or constant acquisition of real-time data must be assured. The process
can block waiting for its time allocation or yield the processor if the
required work is completed before its allocation has been used. This implementation
is more efficient and easier to use than the real-time timers and signals
used in other UNIX implementations.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR29">1.7.3 Processor Sets</a></h4>
<p>
The administrator can reserve sets of processors to run specific tasks,
partitioning the system into groups of CPUs that run batch jobs, real time,
and general timesharing separately. This forces certain classes of users
to run applications on a particular set of processors, and can provide assurance
to, say, batch users that the optimal number of processors they need to
run a parallel batch task will be available when needed.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR30">1.7.4 Processor Cache Affinity</a></h4>
<p>
The scheduler can be instructed to consider the likelihood that data which
a process may have fetched into local cache the last time it was running
may still be in cache on that processor. Waiting a few microseconds to again
run on the original CPU may improve overall throughput by avoiding the penalty
of reloading a new cache.</p>
<p>
For more information on these schedule models and options, see the Silicon
Graphics white papers, Processor Segmentation: A Resource Management Facility
for Shared Memory Multiprocessors and Parallel Throughput Performance of
IRIX 5.x.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR31">1.8 Symmetric Multiprocessing and Multitasking</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 currently supports up to 36 RISC processors on CHALLENGE systems
and 18 on POWER CHALLENGE systems, providing unparalleled performance on
compute-intensive programs. Silicon Graphics pioneered multiprocessor RISC
systems running UNIX. MP versions of IRIX have been available since 1988,
so IRIX 6.2 MP support is based on significantly more mature MP technology
than is available from other RISC system vendors. The features of Silicon
Graphics' multiprocessors allow demonstrable parallel speedups on many technical
and commercial applications, further differentiating IRIX. </p>
<p>
IRIX employs sophisticated synchronization techniques that allow multiple
CPUs to execute in the kernel simultaneously, resulting in a multithreaded
kernel. Within the IRIX kernel are more than 5,000 distinct MP-safe entry
points. This allows very fine-grained locking; access to an individual data
structure is synchronized rather than access to an entire subsystem, reducing
the likelihood that Processor B must wait for Processor A to release a locked
resource. As a result, IRIX offers exceptional scalability and performance
as processors are added.</p>

<h4><a name="HDR32">1.8.1 Synchronization Primitives</a></h4>
<p>
Silicon Graphics process synchronization primitives, such as spin locks,
barriers, and semaphores, are allocated from a shared memory &quot;arena.&quot; These
are memory-mapped between processes and can permit pointers to be shared.
Synchronization primitives are implemented with the MIPS instructions themselves,
allowing for much faster synchronization than in traditional System V mechanisms. </p>
<h4><a name="HDR33">1.8.2 Lightweight Processes</a></h4>
<p>
sproc is an interface that permits users to create lightweight processes
that share the virtual address space (and potentially other attributes)
of the parent process. The parent and child both have their own program
counter value and stack pointer, but all the text and data space is visible
to both processes. This scheme provides one of the basic mechanisms upon
which parallel programs can be built. </p>
<h3><a name="HDR34">1.9 Enhancements to Support 64-bit Computing</a></h3>
<p>
The IRIS Development Option (IDO) for IRIX 6.2 includes MIPSpro<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> compilers technology to generate either:</p>
<ul>
<li>32-bit code for MIPS 2, MIPS 3 or MIPS 4. <br>
 
<li>64-bit code for MIPS 3 or MIPS 4 <br>
 
</ul>
<p>
Over the last several releases, key components of the operating system have
been progressively enhanced to support 64-bit binaries as well as existing
32-bit binaries. These include (but are not limited to):</p>

<h4><a name="HDR36">1.9.2 Include Structures</a></h4>
<p>
Include structures have been modified to provide the correct 32- or 64-bit
sizes. Since both 32- and 64-bit environments are supported under IRIX 6.2,
multiple sets of libraries reside in different directories. 32-bit compilations,
targeted at the R4x00 and MIPS 2 ISA, are the default. The library path
must be changed for other targets.</p>
<p>
Each header file under /usr/include will support both 32-bit and 64-bit
compilation. The following directory structure is used for IRIX 6.2 libraries:</p>

<h4><a name="HDR37">1.9.3 Extended Linking Format</a></h4>
<p>
The IRIX 5.x/SVR4 standard Extended Linking Format (ELF) for object modules
has also been extended to 64-bits. ELF-64 is supported in all the tools
which work with object modules.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR38">1.9.4 Dynamic Shared Objects</a></h4>
<p>
The Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) architecture has been extended to support
64-bit addressing. DSO technology is used to provide upward compatibility
between IRIX 5 and IRIX 6, and by dynamically binding applications to the
appropriate shared libraries at execution time enables a single &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot;
version that can operate without change on a wide variety of MIPS hardware
platforms. </p>

<h3><a name="HDR39">1.10 IRIX 6.2 Application Binary Options</a></h3>
<p>
Developers can target one of three ABIs, depending on their compatibility
and performance goals.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR40">1.10.1 O32 for 32-bit Applications</a></h4>
<p>
32-bit applications from IRIX 5 generally &quot;just run&quot; on IRIX 6.2.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR41">1.10.2 64: Full Addressability and MIPS 4 Performance </a></h4>
<p>
Applications should be ported to 64-bits if they can benefit from such 64-bit
features as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster logical/arithmetic operations<br>
 
<li>Larger virtual address space<br>
 
<li>Very large file sizes<br>
 
</ul>
<p>
64-bit logical/arithmetic operations can increase performance on inner loops
by a factor of two. Large models used in applications such as computational
fluid dynamics or finite element analysis frequently require greater than
2 GB virtual address spaces. Similarly, seismic and reservoir simulation
applications in geophysics commonly use data files far larger than 2 GB.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR42">1.10.3 n32: Speed without Porting</a></h4>
<p>
Applications that already exist were often written with one or more target
platforms in mind, and that target was often a 32-bit system. As a result,
the developer may have consciously or unconsciously &quot;wired in&quot; 32-bit data
structures, pointer lengths, or byte alignments in ways that make a port
to 64- bits difficult. ISVs and others may also want to keep memory images
small (for example) to run on as wide a size range of platforms as possible.</p>
<p>
The n32 Software Developers Kit brings two major benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing 32-bit applications can take full advantage of the performance
features of the MIPS 4 ISA without a 64-bit port.<br>
 
<li>Developers can compile one binary (-n32 -mips3), which runs on all currently
shipping SGI platforms.<br>
 
</ul>
<p>
Developers who simply recompile on IRIX 6.2 with the -n32 -mips4 flags set
will generate binaries that use all 32 floating-point registers, eight argument
registers, and the MADD instruction of the MIPS 4 ISA. With -n32, fundamental
data types do not change: all addressing is 32-bit. Please note, however,
that R4x00 systems do not support MIPS 4 ISA.</p>
<p>
Developers who compile on IRIX 6.2 with the -n32 -mips3 flags set will have
binaries that run faster across the entire current SGI product line.</p>
<p>
Execution and compilation options for IRIX 6.2 and the platforms they run
on are shown in Table 1-6.

<h3><a name="HDR43">1.11 Development Environment</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 provides components to help developing applications to run in a
Silicon Graphics environment. With all necessary execution-only environments
needed to run applications on an IRIX 6.2 system, the development products
and development libraries are available as layered components.</p>
<p>
The base product offering, IRIS Development Option, (IDO), provides the
basic tools and libraries needed for developing IRIX applications. These
include: </p>
<ul>
<li>C compiler that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit development<br>
 
<li>Pertinent code generator<br>
 
<li>OpenGL<br>
 
<li>X11, Motif, and Digital Media libraries<br>
 
<li>Development tools such as dbx, pixie, and prof<br>
 
<li>Online reference manuals<br>
 
</ul>
<p>
For high-performance computational applications, IRIX delivers the highly-optimized
CHALLENGEcomplib for access from either Fortran or C. IRIX 6.2 provides
the additional capability of Power Fortran and Power C compiler preprocessors
for automatic parallelization of applications for execution on multiprocessor
systems.
<p>
Additional compiler options are available, including Fortran 77, Fortran
90, and C++, capable of producing 32-or 64-bit code. IRIX 6.2 provides 32-bit
support for Pascal, Ada83, and Ada95, as well as providing support to the
additional high functionality libraries, such as Open Inventor, Performer,
ImageVision, and ViewKit.
<p>
IRIX 6.2 also provides access to the ProDev application tools. ProDev WorkShop,
an awarding winning X1- based visual development environment, offers unmatched
debugging and performance tuning capabilities, including visual debug tools,
graphical visualization of structures and arrays, source code analysis and
browsing, test coverage, debugging of parallel and single stream codes,
performance analysis, memory leak detection, and build analysis. Tightly
integrated into a cohesive development environment, ProDev WorkShop provides

visual applications for C++. Providing a drag-and-drop mechanism for building
applications with objects, RapidApp offers access to X11, Motif, and ViewKit
visual components as well as providing access to Open Inventor, and ImageVision
Library.</p>
<p>
ProDev/Ada provides the most complete development environment for developing
Ada95 applications, including extending ProDev WorkShop to understand task
based-parallel applications. It provides a validated Ada95 compiler and
Ada95 bindings to all SGI libraries.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR44">1.12 Performance Services</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 includes interfaces that can be used in systems demanding the maximum
possible I/O performance. These features require source changes, but when
used appropriately, the performance gains can be dramatic. These I/O-enhancing
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous I/O<br>
 
<li>Memory-mapped I/O<br>
 
<li>Direct I/O<br>
 
</ul>
<h4><a name="HDR45">1.12.1 Asynchronous I/O </a></h4>
<p>
Traditionally, UNIX systems have allowed a given process to have only one
I/O operation in progress at a time. This situation forced applications
such as database servers that required several concurrent I/O operations
to adopt complex, multiprocess architectures. IRIX 6.2 includes support
for multiple concurrent I/O operations within a single process. The interfaces
comply with the POSIX 1003.1b1993 specification, allowing a user to queue
read(2) and write(2) requests to a device, and receive an optional queued
signal when the request completes. A process can simultaneously queue a
number of requests without having to wait for any of them to complete. Since
the interface is standards-compliant, applications using it are portable.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR46">1.12.2 Memory-Mapped I/O</a></h4>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 supports the SVR4 interfaces for memory-mapped I/O. Using these
interfaces, disk files are visible in the address space of the program,
and can be accessed without explicit I/O operations. The kernel can then
bring in pages as it would for an executable, using the demand paging features
of the virtual memory subsystem.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR47">1.12.3 Direct I/O</a></h4>
<p>Direct I/O enables direct transfers between disk and the user address space.
It bypasses the kernel buffer cache by using DMA to transfer data directly
between the disks and the user address space. Memory-mapped files, by contrast,
make the data in the kernel buffer cache directly accessible from the user
address space.</p>
<p>
Direct I/O requires substantially fewer changes to an existing application
than memory-mapped I/O. Using both direct and asynchronous I/O, the program
can have complete control of its own I/O operations, yielding performance
close to that of raw disk, while retaining the benefits of the filesystem.
The interfaces for direct I/O were defined by Silicon Graphics.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR48">1.13 Real Time</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 includes extensive real-time facilities and interfaces, collectively
referred to as REACT<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> . These allow the configuration of systems that interact with external
events in a fast, guaranteed, and deterministic manner. The key elements
of support for real time in IRIX 6.2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-degrading (fixed priority) scheduling<br>
 
<li>Asynchronous I/O (discussed earlier)<br>
 
<li>Deadline scheduling (discussed earlier)<br>
 
<li>Facilities for memory page locking, to insure that deterministic behavior
is never disrupted by a page fault<br>
 
<li>Bounded, guaranteed interrupt latency on a properly configured multiprocessor
system <br>
 
<li>Processor isolation designates one or more CPUs to handle all kernel overhead<br>
 
<li>Processor restriction allows users to specify which processors run on which
real-time CPUs and to exclude all others<br>
 
<li>Guaranteed rate I/O from the XFS filesystem<br>
 
<li>Queued signals delivered in priority order<br>
 
<li>Real-time processors can be exempted from receiving system clock interrupts
and running the IRIX round-robin schedule<br>
 
<p>
These facilities allow IRIX, with its rich feature set and comprehensive
applications support, to be used in the most demanding real-time environments.
For further information on real-time support in IRIX 6.2, refer to the REACT
in IRIX 6.2 Technical Report.</p>
</ul>
<h3><a name="HDR49">1.14 Supercomputing Features</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 offers features to support unbundled POWER CHALLENGEarray<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> functionality, including the Fair Share Scheduler<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> (based on SHARE II<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> ), kernel level check-point/restart (based on Hibernator II<tt><font size="3">TM</font></tt> ), and extended accounting, all available from Silicon Graphics. Additional
solutions are available from third parties.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR50">1.14.1 Fair Share Scheduler</a></h4>
<p>
The Fair Share scheduler allows system administrators to create a custom
compute-resource allocation policy and apply it to an IRIX-based computing
environment. Administrators can use Fair Share Scheduling to allocate CPU
time, disk space, system memory, connect time, printer pages, and other
resources to those users or departments who most need them.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR51">1.14.2 Checkpoint--Restart</a></h4>
<p>
Hibernator II is a kernel-level job execution management tool. It allows
system administrators to suspend jobs in mid-execution, restarting them
later on the same system or a different machine of the same architecture.
Checkpoint-- Restart allows processes to continue across an administrative
shutdown or system crash, and can also be used to load balance applications
across a number of SGI systems with compatible architectures (IP19 and IP21)
and software environments. </p>
<h4><a name="HDR52">1.14.3 Extended Accounting</a></h4>
<p>
IRIX accounting has traditionally been process-oriented. Once activated,
information logged for each user login included programs run, CPU and wall
clock time, and character and block I/O resources used. IRIX Extended Accounting
adds to these capabilities via projects and array sessions. &quot;Projects&quot; allows
users to bill multiple projects separately. &quot;Array sessions&quot; group processes
together across the nodes of a PC array under a single identifier for unified
accounting, job control, and more. Both forms of extended accounting also
add monitoring of data commonly tracked in a supercomputing environment,
such as swaps, bytes read/written, read/write requests, and time spent waiting
on the run queue and for raw and block I/O.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR53">1.14.4 Other Batch Scheduling Options</a></h4>
<p>
LSF is a load sharing and distributed batch computing product available
on SGI platforms from Platform Computing Corporation in Toronto. It supports
transparent, heterogeneous, remote execution and can interoperate with remote
NQS systems. </p>
<h3><a name="HDR54">1.15 Security</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX 6.2 incorporates technology originally developed for Trusted IRIX/B
for identification, authentication, and auditing. Shadow password support
places encrypted user passwords in a file that is inaccessible to non-privileged
programs, thwarting brute force attacks on the password data base. Auditing
logs security-relevant events, enabling analysis of attempts at unauthorized
entry and changes made to system files and configurations. IRIX 6.2 also
supports automatic password aging, password quality and reuse controls,
and optional login restrictions.</p>
<p>
These features are designed to meet the U.S. Department of Defense &quot;Orange
Book&quot; C2 level of trust. An optional Trusted IRIX/B 6.2 layered product
is available for customers who need a C2 or B1 Level of Trust. Trusted IRIX/B
assures a B1 level security environment while providing the features from
IRIX 6.2 that are required for compatibility with the other Silicon Graphics
products and third-party application software. Multiprocessing, graphics,
real time, the X Window System and networking are all included. </p>
<h3><a name="HDR55">1.16 Internationalization (I18n) and Localization (L10n)</a></h3>
<p>
The IRIX operating environment supports multibyte character sets and local
conventions, and serves as the foundation for the WorldView (TM) family of native language
support products. WorldView merges international character sets and local conventions into
the Indigo Magic user environment on Silicon Graphics workstations. Users can tailor the desktop
to reflect the language interface of their choice from a number of supported languages. Developers
can design applications to support multiple localized versions.</p>
<p>
Silicon Graphics recognizes that it is essential to provide native language
support for its international customers. Documents can be created, edited, and printed in the native
language, and many of the user interfaces are localized as well. These include key user interface
and system messages. Not only is text localized, but formatting of lists, text, and data--such
as date, time, number, and currency--follow native conventions for each country.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics provides the following native language support products:</p>
<dd>WorldView German
<dd>WorldView French
<dd>WorldView Japanese, for Japanese input via Romaji-kana and kana-kanji conversion
<dd>WorldView Korean
<dd>WorldView Chinese, for traditional and simplified Chinese forms
<dd>WorldView Thai
<p>
<p>
For all WorldView products, the Indigo Magic Desktop Interface, Showcase,
and printing support are localized. MediaMial and IRIX system messages are localized specifically
for German, French, Japanese, and Chinese.</p>
<p>
<p>
In addition to the native language support, the IRIX 6.2 provides locale
support. Different languages and different places have different standard ways of formatting such
data as time, dates, and numerical amounts. A database containing such local data formats for
a specific language and location is called a locale. A locale specifies both a language and a country.
If an application program is written in a way that is independent of any locale - that is, if
it is written to use any user-specified locale to provide input and output in the appropriate language
and format - the program is said to be internationalized. If a database for a locale has been created
to allow an internationalized program to use that locale, the program is said to be localized to
that locale.</p>
<p>
The locale information for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Thai are included
as part of the language specific WorldView products. </p>

<h3><a name="HDR56">1.17 System Management</a></h3>
<p>
IRIX offers three different levels of administrative tools, aimed at users
with various needs and professional experience. Cadmin is a set of simple
visual tools for desktop users. IRIXpro is a suite of tools for system administrators.
Performance CoPilot is a tool suite for monitoring local and remote network
performance.</p>
<p>
Silicon Graphics also has developed swmgr, a graphical interface to inst
and gendist, to ease software and patch installation, handle installation
problems, and provide software version tracking. </p>
<p>
A variety of ISVs, including Tivoli, Bull, CosMos/Computer Associates, Legent,
and Raxco, sell system and network management solutions for Silicon Graphics
platforms.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR57">1.17.1 Cadmin</a></h4>
<p>
Cadmin is a simple visual system administration tool for software, performance,
volume, and filesystem management. Users can easily add machines, new users,
and simple devices, monitor status, and perform other low-level, routine
tasks.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR58">1.17.2 IRIXpro<tt><font size="3"></a>TM</font></tt><a name="HDR58"> </a></h4>
<p>
IRIXpro is a suite of tools for the professional systems administrator in
the technical computing market. IRIXpro provides two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propel, rdist-based software and file distribution (integrated with swmgr)<br>
 
<li>ProVision, a centralized SNMP-based system event monitoring tool<br>
 
</ul>

<h3><a name="HDR60">1.18 Backup </a></h3>
<p>Users and Administrators have the option of using traditional tape archiving
tools (cpio, tar, dump) or using the graphical backup and restore utility
that come standard with our systems. We also offer the IRIX NetWorker product
that is a full-featured data management tool for multi-system data backup
and recovery. NetWorker allows for fully unattended backups with superior
performance and scalability.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR61">1.19 Data Migration</a></h3>
<p>
Data Management API (DMIG) allows implementation of hierarchical storage
management software with no kernel modifications as well as high-performance
dump programs without requiring &quot;raw&quot; access to the disk and knowledge of
filesystem structures.</p>
<h3><a name="HDR62">1.20 Compatibility</a></h3>
<p>
Every effort has been made to maintain or expand compatibility between IRIX
versions.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR63">1.20.1 COFF Obsoleted</a></h4>
<p>
IRIX 5 and IRIX 6 binaries are produced using the SRV4 Executable and Linking
Format (ELF) which replaces the ECOFF object format in IRIX 4 and enables
Dynamic Shared Objects. Development and execution of COFF (IRIX 4 and earlier)
binaries is not supported on IRIX 6.2. A utility to find/identify COFF-dependent
binaries is provided with the release and installed on the system. It may
be executed before IRIX 6.2 is installed.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR64">1.20.2 Binary Compatibility between IRIX 5.3 and IRIX 6.2 </a></h4>
<p>
Nearly all binaries built on IRIX 5 can be run under IRIX 6. It may be necessary
to recode or recompile to take advantage of IRIX 6 enhancements. There may
be rare cases---such as applications that examine internal operating system
data structures---in which application code must be recompiled.</p>
<h4><a name="HDR65">1.20.3 Object Compatibility between IRIX 6.1 and IRIX 6.2 </a></h4>
<p>
Except for n32 C++, user object code is compatible between IRIX 6.1 and
IRIX 6.2; however, device drivers and any other applications that access
the hardware directly must be recompiled. </p>
