<h1>UNIX Machines at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the machines you can (hopefully) see in our little UNIX corner of
    RetroFest 2025. Apologies if any of these are missing - they are very old
    and fragile and I fear some might not survive the weekend.
</p>

<h2 id="indigo2">Silicon Graphics POWER Indigo 2</h2>

<p>
    This Silicon Graphics POWER Indigo 2 is a high-end 64-bit single-processor
    UNIX workstation from 1994.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="indigo2.gif" alt="Our POWER Indigo 2">
</p>
<p>
    The Indigo 2 (or Indigo<sup>2</sup>), launched in 1992, was the replacement
    for the 1991's Indigo and was Silicon Graphic's mid-range single-processor
    desktop workstation. It launched with the first mainstream 64-bit processor
    - the <a href="../architectures/index.html#mips">MIPS</a>
    R4000 - in the distinctive teal coloured case you see here. Later models
    could be ordered with a MIPS R4400 processor, which had larger caches and
    higher clockspeeds. These early models came with a choice of three graphics
    cards:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="indigo2_graphics.gif" alt="2-board XZ Graphics">
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>XL Graphics</b> - 1280x1024 at 76 Hz in 24-bit colour. Mostly a 2D card -
    any 3D calculations would be handled by your CPU.</li>
    <li><b>XZ Graphics</b> - the one I have. Comes on two full-length PCBs and includes
    two (later four) Geometry Engines that each give 32 MFLOPs and 250,000
    triangles per second. They are joined by a Raster Engine processor and a
    Command Engine processor but, notably, there is no hardware Texture Mapping.
    Will it play GLQuake? No. Well, maybe, but all the walls would be flat
    colours. It's designed to do CAD.</li>
    <li><b>Extreme Graphics</b> - the top-of-the-line option, coming on three
    PCBs. You get eight Geometry Engines giving you 256 MFLOPs. Still no
    hardware texture-mapping though.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Video output on all three options is using a 13W3 connector, and so to use a
    VGA monitor you require an adapter.
</p>
<p>
    The R4400 was OK, but MIPS (which was bought out by Silicon Graphics in
    1992) was worried that it was getting beaten by its competition (Alpha,
    PA-RISC, HyperSPARC, etc), especially in floating point calculations. Their
    answer to this was the <b>MIPS R8000</b>, launched in June 1994. Despite
    clocking at only 75 MHz, its wide architecture allowed it to perform up to
    300 million floating-point instructions per second (MFLOPS). This CPU was so
    powerful, SGI claimed that, with the same processor count, an R8000 machine
    had the same performance as a Cray Y-MP supercomputer from 1988. The price
    for this performance was steep, although was perhaps very reasonable
    compared to the price of a Cray. The CPU alone cost $2,5000, never mind the
    rest of the computer. This is (at least partly) because instead of being a
    single ceramic package, the CPU is in fact an A5-sized PCB covered in many
    large (and hot) ICs. It worked though, and by November 1994 (less than six
    months after launch), 50 of the world's Top 500 fastest computers were SGI
    POWER Challenge or SGI POWER Onyx servers using the R8000 processor. Looking
    at the list, the lowest placed POWER Challenge was in position 439 and was a
    six-processor machine owned by Volvo. As it happened, SGI ended up buying
    Cray in 1996.
</p>
<p>
    Naturally, computers have moved on somewhat in the last ~30 years, and the
    R8000 is out-performed (but not outclassed) by the ARM11 CPU you get on a
    $10 Raspberry Pi Zero.
</p>
<p>
    The Indigo 2 was, for a short time and at an extraordinary price tag,
    available with a single instance of this the super-computer grade CPU. An
    R8000-equipped Indigo 2 is known in the marketing material as a "POWER
    Indigo 2", and that is what we have here. The short life-span of the POWER
    Indigo 2 was because the MIPS R10K arrived in January 1996, compensating for
    its lowly two-instructions-per-clock cycle FPU performance by having more
    than twice the clock speed of the R8000, and at a much lower price point. At
    about the same time as the R10K came out, the graphics sub-system in the
    Indigo 2 was upgraded from EXTREME Graphics to IMPACT Graphics, and the case
    colour was changed from teal to purple to mark this upgrade.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    The Centre for Computing History has many things in its archive, but it does
    not (last I checked) have a POWER Indigo 2. SGI Depot is perhaps the primary
    on-line resource for SGI spare parts and complete machines, and Ian there
    tells me he doesn't have a POWER Indigo 2 either. If he did have one to sell
    you, his price list says it'd cost you &pound;1400. That's a lot, but it's
    also still a steep discount on the original list price of $75,000.
</p>
<p>
    I have no information about the history of this particular example, other
    than I acquired it from a lovely person called Kestral who I met on social
    media.
</p>
<p>
    This POWER Indigo 2 is running IRIX 6.2 from 1996, which is a little bit
    later than our machine (which would have shipped with IRIX 6.0), but a
    reasonable in-period upgrade.

<h2 id="b132l">Hewlett Packard Visualize B132L+</h2>

<p>
    This Hewlett Packard Visualize B132L+ (from the 'B-series' family) is a
    mid-range single-processor 32-bit UNIX workstation, from 1996.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="b132l_outside.gif" alt="Our HP Visualize B132L+">
</p>
<p>
    HP launched the HP 9000 series in 1984, and initially used a range of
    processor architectures, before settling on HP's own <a
    href="../architectures/index.html#parisc">PA-RISC architecture</a>. The
    array of machines in the line-up is dizzying, but broadly there were servers
    and there were workstations. The HP 9000 Series 700 workstations are perhaps
    the best known, partly because they also had a port of NeXTSTEP OS. HP gave
    up on numbers in 1995, and replaced the 700-series workstations with the
    Visualize B-series, C-series and J-series workstations. B-Series that we
    have was available at 132 MHz (our example), 160 MHz (the B160L) and 180 MHz
    (the B180L) variants, with a choice of standard SCSI or high-voltage
    differential SCSI (you don't want that one). It has integrated 2D graphics,
    and so it a middling UNIX workstation, rather than a fire-breathing graphics
    powerhouse. It has six 72-pin SIMM slots and takes ECC RAM.
</p>
<p>
    This example was actually a server for Cable and Wireless and only came out
    of service recently. The video output has a 'VESA EVC' and the vendor
    thankfully included a VGA adapter.</p>
</p>
<p>
    It is running HP-UX 10.20 from 1996, which is probably what our
    machine should have shipped with. HP-UX 10.20 came with both <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#vue">VUE</a> and its replacement <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">CDE</a>. I've elected to install the
    former, because we've already got a few CDE machines and well, I mean just
    look at those strakes on the launcher panel!

<h2 id="c3000">HP 9000 Visualize C3000</h2>

<p>
    This HP 9000 Visualize C3000 (from the 'C-series' family) is a high-end
    single-processor 64-bit UNIX workstation from 1999.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="c3000_front.gif" alt="Our HP Visualize C3000">
</p>
<p>
    Our C3000 is a later model than the <a href="#b132l">B132L+</a>, sporting a
    64-bit PA-8500 processor, a couple of 64-bit/66 MHz PCI slots, and eight
    non-standard 278-pin DIMM slots that take 120 MHz ECC SDRAM modules. It
    would have been a direct competitor for our <a href="#ultra80">Sun Ultra
    80</a>.

<p>

    This example was actually a server for Virgin Media and only came out of
    service recently. A 3D graphics card was added by the vendor so I wouldn't
    be forced to use the serial console.</p>
</p>
<p>
    It is running HP-UX 11.00 from 1996, which is probably what our machine
    should have shipped with and is the first 64-bit version of HP-UX. HP-UX
    11.00 came with only the <a href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop

<h2 id="ultra80">Sun Ultra 80</h2>

<p>
    This Sun Ultra 80 is a high-end 64-bit multi-processor UNIX workstation
    from 1999.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="ultra80.gif" alt="Our Sun Ultra 80">
</p>
<p>
    This is the top of Sun's workstation line-up from the late 1990's, and can
    take up to four UltraSPARC-II CPU modules. In this machine, we have three
    (the fourth is not working and has been removed). This model was replaced by
    the Ultra 45 in 2006 (which was the last SPARC workstation Sun ever made).
 </p>
 <p>
    Inside, there are 16x 144-pin DIMM slots which take ECC SDRAM. The maximum
    capacity is 4GB. Unfortunately, half the DIMM slots are on a riser board
    which is supported on a plastic frame (as are the CPUs) and this plastic is
    now incredibly prone to cracking. I really hope it surives the journey as
    that plastic is carrying quite a lot of weight. I much prefer the interior
    design of the <a href="#c3000">HP Visualize C3000</a> (which would have been
    a direct competitor), as that has all-metal construction.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="ultra80_inside.gif" alt="The insides of an Ultra 80">
</p>
<p>
    This example is fitted with a 2D graphics card, and the stickers on the case
    indicate it came from Oxford University Computing Laboratory. I like to
    think it was used for C programming and maybe some mathematical modelling in
    MATLAB.
</p>
<p>
    This machine would have shipped with Sun Solaris 7, which was the first
    64-bit version of Solaris and is what I have installed. Solaris 7 came with
    either <a href="../desktops/index.html#openwindows">OpenWindows</a> or the
    <a href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment (CDE)</a>.
    It is also supported by Solaris 8, 9 and 10.

<h2 id="r260">Acorn R260</h2>

<p>
    This Acorn R260 is an entry-level UNIX workstation from 1991.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="r260.gif" alt="Our Acorn R260">
</p>
<p>
    This machine is Acorn's 1991 'second generation' UNIX workstation. Based on
    the ARM3 processor, performance has been boosted by nearly 3 times
    from the previous R140 introduced in 1988.
</p>
<p>
    Created using the same hardware as Acorn's Archimedes range which ran Acorn's RISC OS,
    the 'R' range of machines also added an installation of the UNIX, RISC iX. The
    R260 has the same hardware as the Archimedes A540.
</p>    
<p>
    With a retail price of &pound;4995, this was by far the most expensive computer that Acorn
    had ever produced. Although it cost as much as a small car at the time (and the equivalent of
    &pound;11300 today) this was a 'budget' UNIX offering, costing perhaps half the price
    of the (admittedly faster) competition.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately this is the last Acorn RISC iX model produced, and
	future Acorn machines would ship with RISC OS only. In later
	years Linux and NetBSD were ported to the range, once again providing a
	UNIX experience on the earliest ARM hardware.
