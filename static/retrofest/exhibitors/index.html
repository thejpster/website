<h1>UNIX Exhibitors at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the exhibitors taking part in our little UNIX corner of RetroFest 2025.
</p>

<h2 id="jp">Jonathan 'theJPster' Pallant</h2>
<p>
    Jonathan (or JP to his friends) is an Embedded Systems developer and Rust
    evangelist by day, but has recently fallen into the world of 1990's UNIX
    hardware and software.

<p>
    You can e-mail JP on "retrofest AT thejpster.org.uk". Or you can find him on
    Bluesky (@thejpster.org.uk) or on Mastodon (thejpster@hachyderm.io). He also
    runs https://thejpster.org.uk, which posts blogs about trains and Rust and
    sometimes his adventures with UNIX workstations.
</p>

<p>
    JP brought the Silicon Graphics POWER Indigo 2, Sun Ultra 80, HP Visualize
    B132L+ and HP Visualize C3000. He also owns an Acorn RiscPC 700, Commodore
    128D, Acorn BBC Master, Commodore Amiga 500, two Atari 520STs and a lot of
    consoles.
</p>

<h2 id="ph">Peter 'El Flib/Flibble/Marutan' Howkins</h2>
<p>
    Peter is a Software Engineer by trade. As an enjoyer of all things
    'Acorn Computers' and 'Old UNIX' it seemed natural to bring along a 
    machine where those two overlap. He is a co-developer of the 
    RPCEmu emulator, a free recreation of the Acorn Risc PC. He is also
    one of the maintainers of the open-source release of the
    <a href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment (CDE)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Peter brought the Acorn R260, Acorn Risc PC and RPCEmu machines,
    though not all of them are running UNIX! His collection includes
    20 or so Acorn machines and a dozen or more other items.
