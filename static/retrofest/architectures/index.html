<h1>Processor  Architectures at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the Processor Architectures you can see in our little UNIX corner of RetroFest 2025.
</p>

<h2 id="mips">MIPS</h2>
<p>
    The MIPS architecture was first seen in 1985 in the R2000 processor from
    MIPS Computer Systems. This was followed by the R6000 in 1989, which
    implemented the second-generation "MIPS II" architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Silicon Graphics were MIPS Computer Systems primary customer, and so they
    purchased MIPS Computer Systems outright in 1992, renaming them MIPS
    Technologies. They went on to release the R4000, <a
    href="../machines/index.html#indigo2">R8000</a> and R10K processors used in
    their own Silicon Graphics machines, the R4300 processor used in the
    Nintendo N64, and the R5900 processor used in the Sony Playstation 2. 
</p>
<p>
    MIPS Technologies was spun back out in 1998, when the architecture was
    dropped by Silicon Graphics in favour of Intel's ill-fated Itanium.  Despite
    various owners (including Imagination Technologies for a while) MIPS
    Technologies still exists today. 
</p>

<h2 id="parisc">PA-RISC</h2>
<p>
    PA-RISC, also known as Hewlett Packard Precision Architecture (or HPPA) was
    first introduced by HP in the TS-1 processor of 1986. The processor launched
    in the HP 9000 840 Indigo server (no relation to the Silicon Graphics
    desktop of the same name). That machine cost $113,500 in 1986 dollars. The
    TS-1 processor was not a silicon chip, but instead spanned several 8" x 11"
    PCBs featuring 150 individual ICs.
</p>
<p>
    Later PA-RISC processors were integrated onto a single silicon chip, like
    the PA-7100LC and the PA-7300LC in our <a
    href="../machines/index.html#b132l">HP 9000 Visualize B132L+ desktop</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The final version of the PA-RISC architecture, PA-RISC 2.0, was 64-bit and
    launched in 1996 in the PA-8000 processor. Our <a
    href="../machines/index.html#c3000">HP 9000 Visualize C3000 tower</a>
    features a 64-bit PA-RISC 8500 processor.
</p>
<p>
    The architecture was dropped by HP in favour of Intel's ill-fated Itanium.
</p>

<h2 id="sparc">SPARC</h2>
<p>
    The Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC) was introduced by Sun in 1987 as
    SPARC V7 (I have no idea why they started at V7). Processors based on this
    architecture were used across Sun's lineup (such as the SPARCstation). The
    SPARC architecture was open-sourced in 1989 and is managed by SPARC
    International. Apart from Sun (later Oracle), SPARC processors have also
    been designed by Fujitsu, Texas Instruments and the European Space Agency.
</p>
<p>    
    SPARC V8 was released in 1992, in the SuperSPARC series of processors.
    1993's SPARC V9 moved the architecture to 64-bit, and was implemented by the
    UltraSPARC processors (as used in the Sun Ultra line of machines, like our
    <a href="../machines/index.html#ultra80">Sun Ultra 80</a>).
</p>
<p>
    The SPARC processors were phased out by Sun (on the desktop at least) in
    around 2005 in favour of the 64-bit AMD Opteron. The last SPARC processor
    from Oracle (who bought Sun) was the server-class SPARC M8 in 2017. The
    architecture lives on though, especially in spaceflight applications using
    derivatives of the European Space Agency's LEON processor. 
</p>

<h2 id="arm">ARM</h2>
<p>
    The ARM architecture was first seen in 1985 in the ARM 1 processor
    available as a technology-preview add-on to the BBC Micro. Designed
    internally at Acorn, the design was intentionally simple to keep
    development and production costs low.
</p>
    
<p>
    The first computers to ship with an ARM processor were Acorn's
    Archimedes range in 1987. These featured the ARM 2 processor clocked 
    at 8 MHz. 
</p>
    
<p>
	In 1989 the ARM 3 processor was released, increasing the clock speed
	to 25 MHz and adding a 4KB cache. This processor was used to update
	Acorn's Archimedes range and is the processor in our
	<a href="../machines/index.html#r260">Acorn R260</a>.
</p>

<p>
	ARM processor development was spun out of Acorn in 1990 into a new
	company, ARM Ltd (A partnership of Acorn, Apple and VLSI Technologies).
	During the 1990's the ARM processor became wildly popular as a CPU
	in use in mobile phones, a market it remains dominant in to this day.
