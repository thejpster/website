<h1>UNIX Operating Systems at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the UNIX operating systems you can (hopefully) see in our little
    UNIX corner of RetroFest 2025. Apologies if any of these are missing - the
    machines are very old and fragile and I fear some might not survive the
    weekend.
</p>

<h2 id="irix">Silicon Graphics IRIX 6.2</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    IRIX 6.2 is a UNIX for the 64-bit MIPS IV architecture, based on UNIX System
    V Release 4. It uses ELF executables, like Linux does. It was released in
    1996, and replaced by IRIX 6.5 in 1998 (IRIX 6.5 was the last version and
    was supported until 2013). It comes with the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#magic">Indigo Magic Desktop</a>.

<h2 id="solaris">Sun Solaris 7</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Solaris 7 is a UNIX for 32-bit and 64-bit SPARC, as well as x86, based on
    UNIX System V Release 4. It uses ELF executables, like Linux does. It was
    released in November 1998 and supported until August 2008. It comes with <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#openwindows">OpenWindows</a> and the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="hpux10">HP-UX 10.20</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#b132l">HP 9000 Visualize
    B132L+</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    HP-UX 10.20 is a UNIX for 32-bit PA-RISC, released in 1996. It includes a
    Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and a journalled filesystem (VxFS). It is based
    on UNIX System V Release 4. It was replaced by HP-UX 11.00 but was supported
    until 2003. It comes with <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#vue">HP VUE</a> desktop and the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="hpux11">HP-UX 11.00</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#c3000">HP 9000 Visualize
    C3000</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    HP-UX 11.00 is a UNIX for 32-bit and 64-bit PA-RISC, released in 1997. It is
    based on UNIX System V Release 4. Compared to HP-UX 10.20, it adds full
    64-bit addressing, and drops the HP VUE desktop, leaving CDE as the only
    option.  It was replaced by HP-UX 11.11 (also known as HP-UX 11i) but was
    supported until 2006. It comes with the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="riscix">RISC iX 1.2.1</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#r260">Acorn R260</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    RISC iX was first releaseed in 1988. It is a  port of BSD 4.3 to the <a href="../architecture/index.html#arm">ARM architecture</a> with extra features such as System V
    extensions, the X Window System (X11R2 later R4), the Norcroft C
    Compiler, and Sun's NFS. It provided a reasonably complete UNIX system
    for the early 1990's.
</p>
<p>
    RISC iX 1.2 replaces 1.1's IXI's X.desktop with the
    <a href="../desktops/index.html#mwm">Motif Window Manager</a> as the default,
    though IXI's desktop tools remain available.
