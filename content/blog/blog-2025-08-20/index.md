## Background

I was browsing [/r/vintagecomputing](https://reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing), as you do, and I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/1mp7r9w/about_30_sun_sparc_workstations_need_a_new_home/):

>  Hi all. Back in the day I was a developer working exclusively on Solaris. About 25 years ago, for one reason and another I came into possession of about 30 assorted SPARC based workstations and a few other bits and bobs, network/SCSI cards, keyboards, mice, etc. I think there's also one UltraSPARC in there too. This stuff was well past its prime even then.
>
> I need to clear out the space they're stored in and it would be a shame for them to end up in landfill, so if anyone wants them they're free to a good home. They're currently located in West Berkshire, England.
>
> It should be noted that none of these machines have been powered up in well over a decade. I've no idea if any of them still work and with the exception of the one UltaSPARC I'm not sure what use they'd be to anyone. But the offer's there. 

Free SPARC machines? Not too far from me? Well it would be rude not to.

If you're new here, hi! I have been on a bit of a 90's RISC/UNIX bender recently - see [previous posts](@/blog/blog-2025-07-19/index.md).

Clearly I need some IBM RS/6000 in my life, but they are hard to find. And clearly I need some 32-bit SPARCV8, to go with the 64-bit SPARCV9 Ultra 80. Also I need more space. And money. Send help.

## The Collection

The machines were in Newbury and the owner needed to clear the whole lot, so wasn't particularly interested in people coming and collecting one at a time. So, I said I could come down right away (it's only a ~3 hour drive each way) and take as many as would fit into my car. The vendor was actually surprised at all the interest, and in the end we agreed I could take about half the pile, leaving half for the other people who were coming later.

Newbury is about 120 miles from me, so on Monday 18 August, I set off at 5pm for Operation SPARC RESCUE. The trip was uneventful and the vendor was very kind, and six hours later I'm back at home and realising I really don't have anywhere to put them.

{{ image(img="blog/blog-2025-08-20/boot.jpg") }}

So what do we have?

## The Machines

From newest to oldest we have:

* 1x [Sun Fire V100](https://dogemicrosystems.ca/wiki/Sun_Fire_V100) rack-mount server
* 1x [Sun Netra T1](https://dogemicrosystems.ca/wiki/Sun_Netra_T1_105) rack-mount server
* 3x [Sun SPARCstation 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_20) pizza-boxes
* 1x [Sun SPARCstation 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_5) pizza-box wearing a SPARCstation 20 lid - this was quite the surprise
* 1x [Sun SPARCstation 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_5) pizza-box
* 1x [Sun SPARCstation 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_10) pizza-box
* 2x [Sun SPARCstation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_2) pizza-boxes
* 1x [Sun SPARCstation 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1) pizza-box

The machines have various labels indicating many of them came from the investment bank [Credit Suisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse). It was also interesting to see how the cases got more plastic (and I presume cheaper) as time went on. The early stuff is very heavy and has a lot of metal - the later stuff, not so much.

## Sun Fire V100 - circa 2002

A rack-mount server with a 500MHz 64-bit UltraSPARC-IIe, and 1024 MiB of RAM. No hard disks. There's a smart-card installed in a slot at the rear of the machine, which I believe holds system configuration information (pretty clever idea really - it would make it easy to bring up a replacement machine with the same MAC address as a failed one).

The Lights-Out Management (LOM) works over Serial (9600/8N1) with a DE9 to RJ45 adapter cable. The LOM starts up OK, and the machine gets to the OpenFirmware 4.0 prompt. It uses EIDE internally, and has no hard disks but does have a slim-line CD-ROM. I threw in a spare 9GB Quantum EIDE drive and it seemed to detect it. It came with a Debian Etch CD-R in the tray, but I crashed on boot with *Illegal Instruction*:

I have no idea if I should be able to boot this random CD or not. I also tried a random Solaris 7 CD I had, but again, I don't know if that's actually supposed to work in this machine. It seems clean and tidy inside and passes POST, so it's probably fine. Quite loud though - perhaps better suited to someone with a [clabretro](https://clabretro.com/) style homelab.

## Sun Netra T1 - circa 1999

The Netra T1 is another rack-mount system. This one doesn't have rails, or a front panel, and the lid is a bit bent. Inside we've got two 3.5" SCSI drives in hot-swap bays. Using the same RJ25 serial LOM connector as the V100, we see:

Wow, the POST has a lot to say for itself - so much more than the later V100. It appears we have a 440 MHz UltraSPARC-IIi with 1024 MiB of RAM. Let's look at those two SCSI hard disk drives:

```text
ok probe-scsi 
Primary UltraSCSI bus:
Target 1 
  Unit 0   Disk     FUJITSU MAN3184M SUN18G 1804
```

OK, well it sees one of them. Unlike the V100 this one has a high-density 68-pin SCSI connector on the back instead of a CD-ROM drive, so I could probably boot it from a BlueSCSI. We also have a Seagate drive fitted, but it doesn't appear to be detected. Given my experience with Seagate SCSI drives, this does not surprise me. We cannot boot the Fujitsu drive - I suspect it has been wiped:

```text
ok boot disk
Boot device: /pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/scsi@2/disk@0,0  File and args: 
Unrecognized magic number in media label
Can't open disk label package

Can't open boot device
```

## SPARCstation 1

We have a single SPARCstation 1. It looks OK inside, with on Maxtor hard disk. Applying mains power gives no results though - and checking the rails, there's only 1.5V on the +12V rail. That means no fans and no RS-232 drivers.

{{ image(img="blog/blog-2025-08-20/ss1.jpg") }}

I opened the PSU and it didn't look too bad inside - no obvious bulging or leaking. Note to the unwary - DO NOT REMOVE THE SCREWS ON THE SIDE. They hold on the transistor heatinks and are a right faff to refit. Simply ask your qualified electrical engineer to remove the small black machine screw at the end, and slide off the bottom cover towards the screw. The fan can remain in place.

## CSFB SPARCstation2

This is one of two SPARCstation 2 units - the one stickered as belonging to Credit Suisse. Applying power and we have success - it does a POST over Serial Port A. The hard drives spin up but the bearings sound horrific. I highly doubt they are usable. It also takes *forever* to check the RAM. Also I think the disk is blank. But, it's got power!

{{ image(img="blog/blog-2025-08-20/csfb-ss2.jpg") }}

Annoying these early machines have DB25F ports and I only have a DB25F cable. So ...

This works, don't judge me. Here's the console output on boot:

We can. Let's [set up the NVRAM](http://www.obsolyte.com/sunFAQ/faq_nvram.html) and try and boot it. Type 0x55 is correct for a SPARCstation 2.

Yeah!

## MORSE SPARCstation 2

The second SPARCstation 2 has a MORSE sticker on it. I have no idea what that is. It also has a wonky foot that seems to have come off and been stuck back on at 45 degrees.

{{ image(img="blog/blog-2025-08-20/morse-ss2.jpg") }}

This one also starts up. It has 32 MiB of RAM so POST merely takes an *age* as opposed to *eons*.

The NVRAM set-up is as before. Do the disks appear? They are very quiet.

```
ok probe-scsi
Target 1 
  Unit 0   Disk     SEAGATE ST11200N SUN1.05950000000000Copyright (c) 1993 Seagate All rights reserved 0000
Target 3

ok boot disk
Boot device: /sbus/esp@0,800000/sd@3,0   File and args: 
```

That just hangs - I guess the disks are no good. But it boots from BlueSCSI:

```text
ok boot cdrom
Boot device: /sbus/esp@0,800000/sd@6,0:c   File and args:

```

Excellent. That's enough for now.

## Wrapping up

OK, I've got an SS10, two SS5s and three SS20s left to try - and the SS20s are missing CPU cards and RAM. Lets look at those next time.
