<h1>UNIX Desktop Environments at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the Desktop Environments you can see in our little UNIX corner of
    RetroFest 2025.
</p>

<h2 id="cde">Common Desktop Environment (CDE)</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#c3000">HP 9000 Visualize
    C3000</a> and <a href="../machines/index.html#dec3000axp">DEC 3000 Model
    800 AXP</a>, and available on the
    <a href="../machines/index.html#ultra80">Sun Ultra 80</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) was introduced in 1993, as part of the
    Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. COSE a joint effort
    between HP, SCO, IBM, Sun, UNIX System Labs and Univel (a brief
    joint-venture from AT&amp;T and Novell). The aim was to unify the commercial
    UNIX market, on the premise that a common desktop would make it easier to
    train users, and port applications between the various UNIXes. The result
    was something very ... professional? Boring? Try HP VUE and CDE side-by-side
    and you can clearly see the heritage.
</p>
<p>
    CDE uses the Motif widget toolkit to draw the buttons, text boxes, and so
    on, and the Motif window manager to draw the window frames, maximise /
    minimise controls, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The last major release was in 1997, although it continued to be supported
    long after. Both CDE and Motif were released as open source in 2012. If you
    have Linux, You could try writing Motif applications yourself!
</p>

<h2 id="magic">Silicon Graphics Indigo Magic Desktop</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#indigo2">Silicon Graphics
    POWER Indigo 2</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Silicon Graphics' IRIX operating system started shipping the Indigo Magic
    Desktop with IRIX 5.1 in 1993. It replaced an earlier desktop called IRIS
    WorkSpace. Indigo Magic Desktop was renamed to IRIX Interactive Desktop in
    1998, and continues on today as a desktop for Linux called the MaXX
    Interactive Desktop.
</p>
<p>
    As you use Indigo Magic Desktop you'll notice it has sounds and animations
    that set it apart from other UNIX desktop environments. It even has 'modern'
    ideas like an icon on the desktop for the CD-ROM drive that changes when a
    CD is inserted. Indigo Magic Desktop uses the Motif widget toolkit, just
    like CDE. The default window manager is 4Dwm. 
</p>

<h2 id="openwindows">Sun OpenWindows</h2>
<p>
    <i>Available on the <a href="../machines/index.html#ultra80">Sun Ultra
    80</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    OpenWindows was first released in 1989 as an add-on to SunOS 4 (the
    predecessor to Solaris). OpenWindows 3.6 shipped in Solaris 8, but was
    dropped for Solaris 9. The widget toolkit is OPEN LOOK, which was a
    joint-effort between Sun and AT&T. OPEN LOOK has a very different
    look-and-feel to its main rival - the Motif toolkit. Motif was the one
    picked for CDE, and OPEN LOOK has now died out.
</p>

<h2 id="vue">HP Visual User Environment (VUE)</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#b132l">HP 9000 Visualize
    B132L+</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    VUE started at Apollo Computer in 1998, running on their Domain/OS. Apollo
    were purchased by HP in 1989 and VUE 2.0 was released with HP-UX 8, and VUE
    3.0 with <a href="../operating-systems/index.html#hpux10">HP-UX</a> 9 and 10.
    By the time HP-UX 11.00 came along in 1997, the only desktop included was
    CDE.
</p>
<p>
    If you think HP VUE looks a bit like CDE, well that's because HP donated
    much of its VUE desktop to the CDE project. VUE uses the Motif widget
    toolkit.
</p>

<h2 id="mwm">Motif Window Manager</h2>
<p>
  <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#r260">Acorn R260</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Before there was CDE and the Indigo Magic Desktop, and even before
    there was VUE, there was Motif and the Motif Window Manager. Motif was created
    originally by teams from HP, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and
    Microsoft. Motif started in 1987 as a widget toolkit for X Windows
    that was explicitly designed to meet the style defined in IBM's
    'Common User Access' (CUA) standard. CUA  was also embodied
    in the GUIs of IBM's OS/2 and Microsoft's Windows 3.
</p>
<p>
    Later Motif and MWM (the Motif Window Manager) development was managed
    by OSF (Open Software Foundation), a cooperative group of UNIX vendors
    who were all given access to extend and modify the code, allowing them
    to customise and enhance their own MWM derived desktops, including SGI's
    Indigo Magic Desktop, Digital's DECWindows, Apollo's (later HP's) VUE,
    and IXI's X.desktop.
</p>
<p>
   Today Motif and MWM are free software and are still available to install on modern
   Linux and BSD systems.
