<h1>UNIX Operating Systems at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the UNIX operating systems you can (hopefully) see in our little
    UNIX corner of RetroFest 2025. Apologies if any of these are missing - the
    machines are very old and fragile and I fear some might not survive the
    weekend.
</p>

<h2 id="irix">Silicon Graphics IRIX 6.2</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#indigo2">POWER Indigo 2</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    IRIX 6.2 is a UNIX for the 64-bit MIPS IV architecture, based on UNIX System
    V Release 4. It uses ELF executables, like Linux does. It was released in
    1996, and replaced by IRIX 6.5 in 1998 (IRIX 6.5 was the last version and
    was supported until 2013). It comes with the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#magic">Indigo Magic Desktop</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="solaris">Sun Solaris 7</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#ultra80">Sun Ultra 80</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Solaris 7 is a UNIX for 32-bit and 64-bit SPARC, as well as x86, based on
    UNIX System V Release 4. It uses ELF executables, like Linux does. It was
    released in November 1998 and supported until August 2008. It comes with <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#openwindows">OpenWindows</a> and the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="hpux10">HP-UX 10.20</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#b132l">HP 9000 Visualize
    B132L+</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    HP-UX 10.20 is a UNIX for 32-bit PA-RISC, released in 1996. It includes a
    Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and a journalled filesystem (VxFS). It is based
    on UNIX System V Release 4. It was replaced by HP-UX 11.00 but was supported
    until 2003. It comes with <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#vue">HP VUE</a> desktop and the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="hpux11">HP-UX 11.00</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#c3000">HP 9000 Visualize
    C3000</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    HP-UX 11.00 is a UNIX for 32-bit and 64-bit PA-RISC, released in 1997. It is
    based on UNIX System V Release 4. Compared to HP-UX 10.20, it adds full
    64-bit addressing, and drops the HP VUE desktop, leaving CDE as the only
    option.  It was replaced by HP-UX 11.11 (also known as HP-UX 11i) but was
    supported until 2006. It comes with the <a
    href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="riscix">RISC iX 1.2.1</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#r260">Acorn R260</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    RISC iX was first releaseed in 1988. It is a  port of BSD 4.3 to the <a href="../architecture/index.html#arm">ARM architecture</a> with extra features such as System V
    extensions, the X Window System (X11R2 later R4), the Norcroft C
    Compiler, and Sun's NFS. It provided a reasonably complete UNIX system
    for the early 1990's.
</p>
<p>
    RISC iX 1.2 replaces 1.1's IXI's X.desktop with the
    <a href="../desktops/index.html#mwm">Motif Window Manager</a> as the default,
    though IXI's desktop tools remain available.
</p>

<h2 id="digitalunix">Digital UNIX V4.0</h2>
<p>
    <i>Available on the <a href="../machines/index.html#dec3000axp">DEC 3000 Model 800 AXP</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Digital UNIX, formerly DEC OSF/1 AXP and subsequently renamed again to
    Tru64 UNIX, is a 64-bit operating system for the Alpha architecture.
    It was first released in March 1993.  The OS is based on the Mach modular
    kernel, hosting Unix services in user space.  It comes with the DECwindows
    Motif desktop and the <a href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop
    Environment</a>.

<h2 id="openvms">OpenVMS V7.2</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#dec3000axp">DEC 3000 Model 800 AXP</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    OpenVMS, often referred to as just VMS, as it was called originally, was
    developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for their line of VAX
    minicomputers.  It was first released in August 1978.  It comes with the
    DECwindows Motif desktop and the
    <a href="../desktops/index.html#cde">Common Desktop Environment</a>.
</p>
<p>
    VMS is fairly well known for its clustering and high availability.  It is
    still supported to this day for a small number of serious users who can't
    quite migrate just yet.
</p>
<p>
    After the VAX, VMS was ported to DEC Alpha and Intel Itanium, both of which
    died shortly thereafter.  What that spells for the x86-64, which VMS has
    just recently been ported to, remains to be seen.
